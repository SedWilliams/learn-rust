# Testing and Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Write a test for new functionality that we know fails (initially).
* Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass and the feature functional.
* Refactor the code while ensuring all tests still pass and the feature is still functional.
* Repeat the process for new features or improvements.

This is the procedure for Test Driven Development as outlined in the _Rust Programming Language_ book.
