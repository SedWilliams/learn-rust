     * Borrowing (pointers/references)
     * - For if you want to use a value without taking ownership of it
     * - References -> pointers to the reference holding the pointer to the values location in mem.
     * - This prevents 'data races' see rust book, section 4.2
     * - References go in and out of scope independently of the data they point to
