    /***************************
     * Rust 'Ownership' Rules 
     ***************************/

    //1. Each piece of data in Rust has an 'Owner', a reference to a memory location (a variable)
    //   is an owner
    //2. Each memory location can only have one Owner at a time.
    //
    //3. When the owner goes out of scope, the memory is dropped automatically.


    /***************************
     * Scope
     ***************************/
    // Global scope (project scope)
    // File scope
    // Function scope
    // Block scope
    // Expression scope
