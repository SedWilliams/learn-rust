# IO practice project for learning Rust

This is a practice project from the book "Learning Rust" by Paul Johnson. 
The project implements rust features from previous chapters, focusing on 
input/output (IO) operations.

The goal of the project is to create a grep clone in the command line using Rust.

## What is grep?

GREP (*G*lobally search a *R*eg*E*xp and *P*rint) - is a command line utility that 
allows users to search for specific patterns within files or input streams.
